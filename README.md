Analysis on Kickstarter Data to look at different trends
#1 Challenge 
Analysis on Outcomes based on Goals
In my opinion there could have been more data like what is the reason the Campaign failed or was successful for us to come to a better conclusion.  Secondly different goals have different number of total projects which won’t really give us the exact picture of successful and failed percentage.
As per the data we can conclude that:
•	Goals with 1000-5000 has the highest number of campaigns and success rates.
•	If the goal is over 45000 there is about 85% or more chance for campaign to fail.
•	In order to be 70% or more successful, one should target for up to 5000 goal amounts.

Analysis Based on Launched Date
Looking at the data the months of May and June seems to be most successful with highest number of campaigns and highest number of success rate. But we can dig down more to see the most successful and failed subcategory which will give us the more precise picture as to what kind of campaign one should run.
As per the data we can conclude that:
•	December is not the best month to run a campaign as it more likely to fail.
•	Mid-year months is the best time to be successful in launching a campaign.
•	One should keep in mind that although Months of May and June had a great success rate but they also had fair amount of failed campaigns.
